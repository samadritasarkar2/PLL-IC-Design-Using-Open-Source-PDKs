This two day tapeout workshop on **Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) IC design using Open-Source Google-Skywater 130nm node** involved designing a simple PLL using Open-Source tools. 

The labs covered the entire IC design flow from circuit design until tapeout using Open-Source 130nm Process Design Kits (PDKs) by Google-Skywater and the latest Caravel Framework by efabless. The spice simulations were done using the [ngspice](http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/) Open-Source EDA. The Layout design and parasitic extraction were done using [Magic](http://opencircuitdesign.com/) EDA tool.

## Introduction to PLL
A phase-locked loop or PLL is a control system that generates an output signal whose phase is related to its input.
